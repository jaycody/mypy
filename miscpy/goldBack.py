Test the GoldBack Conjecture.

This script tests the GoldBach conjecture for all integers between 4-100.
- Every even number greater than 2 can be expressed by the sum of two primes
- For every even number between 4-100, print the 2 primes whose sums = that even number
- Clues: 
	1. generate a list of primes
	2. add each prime to each other prime
- Use Big-O notation to express the time complexity
