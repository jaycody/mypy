###python gongfu  ==>  'work + time/effort'

- Kung fu/Kungfu or Gung fu/Gongfu (Listeni/ˌkʌŋˈfuː/ or /ˌkʊŋˈfuː/; 功夫, Pinyin: gōngfu) is a Chinese term referring to any study, learning, or practice that **requires patience, energy, and time to complete.**  

- In its original meaning, kung fu can refer to any **skill achieved through hard work and practice,** not necessarily martial arts. The Chinese literal equivalent of "Chinese martial art" would be 中國武術 zhōngguó wǔshù.

- In Chinese, Gōngfu (功夫) is a compound of two words, combining 功 (gōng) meaning "work", "achievement", or "merit", and 夫 (fū) which is alternately treated as being a word for "man" or as a particle or nominal suffix with diverse meanings (the same character is used to write both). A literal rendering of the first interpretation would be "achievement of man", while the second is often described as "work and time/effort". 

- the connotation is that of an accomplishment **arrived at by great effort of time and energy.**

- Originally, to practice kung fu did not just mean to practice Chinese martial arts. Instead, it referred to the **process of one's training - the strengthening of the body and the mind, the learning and the perfection of one's skills** - rather than to what was being trained. 

- It refers to excellence achieved through **long practice in any endeavor.**  This meaning can be traced to classical writings, especially those of Neo-Confucianism, which emphasize the importance of effort in education.

- In the colloquial, one can say that a person's kung fu is good in cooking, or that someone has kung fu in calligraphy; saying that a person possesses kung fu in an area implies skill in that area, which they have worked hard to develop. 

- Someone with "bad kung fu" simply has not put enough time and effort into training, or seems to lack the motivation to do so
